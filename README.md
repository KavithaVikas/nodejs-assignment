This repositry is about exploring how to convert a video to any image format on the frame mentioned.

First we need to understand what is streaming.

Streaming is a collection of data (it can be array/number/string) but whose length is not known and not stored in memory.

So to understand more on streaming with live example see code in app.js

app.js

In app.js I am using express framework to serve the requests from client and i am running the server on port 3005.
We have videos folder where I have placed to videos sample1.mp4 and sample2.mp4.
We have simple "get" route with path and query string ("/api/playvideo/:videoname") which serves video to client with content type video/mp4.
Now run app.js by command node app.js.
Go to browser open http://localhost:3005/api/playvideo/sample2.mp4 or

 http://localhost:3005/api/playvideo/sample1.mp4

 you can see the streaming . How? You can see video below loading in chunks try to drag the video it will not allow as video is not loadded completly.
 
 To achieve this I have used nodejs's fs module which will create stream and pipe function which will serve the streamed data.

 Yes I know this is not the assignment but I explored this while doing this assignment.

 Now moving on to assignment:

 "decode the video stream of an mp4 file and save the decoded images to local directory in bmp format".

 To achieve this first I thought let me split videos into chunks then convert to image. But couldnt achieve it.
 Then i used fs modules readable to achieve same, I was able to generate chunks but not able to convert them to image.

 Then finally after exploring I got to know about ffmpeg command.

 ffmpeg A complete, cross-platform solution to record, convert and stream audio and video.

 So now how to achieve this in nodejs. As my system was mac from brew command which is mac systems package manager I installed the FFMPEG. Then I ran below command which converts videos to image one frame per second. 

 ffmpeg -i videos/sample1.mp4  -vf fps=1 out%d.bmp.

 Ok! First part was done able to convert video to image. But how to achieve this in node js.

 There is module in node js "child-process".The child_process module enables us to access Operating System functionalities by running any system command inside a, well, child process.We can also control the arguments to be passed to the underlying OS command, and we can do whatever we want with that commandâ€™s output.

 The spawn function launches a command in a new process and we can use it to pass that command any arguments.

 So if you see file "appUseChildProcessModule" using child-process spawn and command ffmpeg we are converting video to image for every second. So for 5 second image 5 bmp images got generated. You can run and see this by node appUseChildProcessModule.js

 Note: please install ffmpeg command from internet based on windows/mac.
